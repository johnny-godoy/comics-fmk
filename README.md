# comics-fmk
A f*ck-marry-kill game for comic book characters. 

It prints out 3 characters, and you have to decide which one you'd f*ck, marry, and kill. *Please ignore a batch with underage characters, it is pending work to remove them entirely from the database.*


It includes a wiki link for each characters.

Just run the `get_fmk.py` script to use!
